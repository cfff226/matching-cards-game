## Animal Match 

### The cartoon matching pairs game

### User Experience (UX)

## Project Goal

### The goal of the game is for the User to enjoy a relaxing, simple but challenging game. Animal Match is aimed towards all ages and offers three levels of difficulty for more variation. Animal Match requires minimal IT skills to navigate and there are clear instructions which are listed in the Modal.

### User Goal:

To enjoy a the colourful, consistent aesthetic of the matching pairs game.
To be able to navigate easily and freely throughout the website.
To have the option of how challenging the game will be.
To be able to play the game across different devices with varying screen sizes.
To be able to keep track of current score for each game whilst playing.

### My goals as a Developer:

* To build a fully functioning matching card game with the use of Html, Css, Javascript Vanilla and JQuery. 
* To learn and familiarise myself with all languages which were used, in order to improve my skills and understand the languages can work simultaneously for specific purposes.

### Addressed Goals:

Animal Match has a vibrant colour scheme, which is consistent throughout the landing page and the modal. 
The website offers minimal options for navigation, as when the modal appears, there are three buttons for choosing the level, then as soon as one of these are clicked, the modal is then hidden. After the game has finished, the user has the option to click Start Again for the modal to then re appear.
There is quite a differentiation between levels of difficulty, which creates more elements and variation to the game.
The game is responsive across all screen sizes.
The images are colourful and consistent, to match the general aesthetic.
The background colour and border are to stand out, as the game itself is minimalistic and simple, so the colours are chosen to balance that out.

### User Stories:

As someone with a basic level of IT skills I would like to see the following:
To understand what the game is and how to play, in a short amount of time of visiting the website.
To have a minimal design and navigation, so that I am able to make choices clearly based on what I how much of a challenge I want the game to be.
To be able to keep track of my score and essentially beat my previous personal best score. 
To see colourful, neat, images which are consistent and clear to look at.


### Design:
The colour scheme was originally a combination of three softer, more pastel tones. However I decided to seek out colour which are brighter and bold. I visited https://coolors.co/ to browse through a number of colour schemes before I picked three from the same palette. The design is consistent throughout the website. The bright colours are balanced out with minimal content, to prevent visual overload and to keep the design simple. The main focus are the game and essentially the cards, so the design supports this. The colours shown below include the three key colours used for the design.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

* As someone with a basic level of IT skills I would like to see the following:
To understand what the game is and how to play, in a short amount of time of visiting the website. - The website modal is with immediate affect, this is where the instructions are listed and the user has the choice of what level to click. Upon choosing, the relevant cards will display and the modal will hide until ‘Start Again’  is clicked.

* To have a minimal design and navigation, so that I am able to make choices clearly based on what I how much of a challenge I want the game to be. - The design is kept very minimal and simple, with the aim to not overload the content, as the main focus is the pictures on the cards.

* To be able to keep track of my score and essentially beat my previous personal best score. - There is a score counter which keeps track of every attempt at a match, this is available for all levels.

* To see colourful, neat, images which are consistent and clear to look at. - All images are clear with no distortion from size changing. The images were taken one two separate sources so they’re all a relatively similar design to fit the theme.


## Further Testing

### Known Bugs

* The border was breaking on smaller devices when playing the levels, where more cards are shown so it has been removed when viewed on smaller screens.

* When matching cards I have noticed the score decrease before increasing again, this is only a very rare glitch and nothing is shown in the console when this happens.

## Deployment of project:

### Github was used to deploy this project, the steps are as follows:

Log into Github and find the Github Repository.
Locate the ‘Settings’ button, at the top of the Repository.
Locate the ‘Github Pages’ section which is at the bottom of the ‘Settings’ page.
Click the ‘None’ dropdown, which is located underneath ‘Source’ and select ‘Master Branch’. The page will refresh.
Scroll back down the page to find the newly published site link in the ‘GitHub Pages’ section.	The link to view on Github Pages INSERT LINK

### Forking the GitHub Repository

This method will make a copy of the original repository to the Github account. This will be used in the event of the User wanting to make changes to the repository, without affecting the original. Instructions for this are as follows:
Log on to Github and locate the GitHub Repository
Find the ‘Settings’ button on the menu and locate the ‘Fork’ button.
This will create a copy of the original repository that you should now see in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

Log in to Github and locate the GitHub Repository
Click ‘Clone or download’.
If you’re using HTTPS, locate ‘Clone with HTTPS’, then copy the link provided.
Open Git Bash.
Change the location of the current directory to your location of choice.
Type git clone and then paste the URL which you copied in Step 3.

### Credits

* Code

* Bootstrap 4.5 was used for the grid in the html, the buttons and the modal. Bootstrap enables a smooth, responsive design when using these. However these are tweaked and code is applied to them in ways relevant to the Animal Match design.

### Content

The project was written with reference to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjyDOHzKN0w
I found this tutorial very useful and simple, this tutorial was followed to create the main functionality of Animal Match. Aside from this, all code is written by myself, with reference to forums such as Stack Overflow for assistance on methods and correcting syntax.
